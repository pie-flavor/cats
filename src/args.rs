// I have complete control over the interface, so I opted to go the path of least resistance and make all arguments named and not positional.
// Clap (structopt) does not allow an argument to be both positional and named so I would need to duplicate those arguments.
// In a real project I would do that anyway, for the ergonomics, but not necessarily as a priority.

// There is no theoretical upper limit on the number of cats in the world, and even the practical one exceeds the buffer capacity of the Windows terminal.
// To that end in a real project I would have added pagination, a result cap, compressed formatting when it's approached, and a flag to exceed it on purpose.
